        "description": "Bilimbi fruits are small, averaging 4 to 10 centimeters in length and 1 to 2 centimeters in diameter, and have an elongated, oblong, cylindrical, to ellipsoidal shape with blunt, slightly tapered ends. The fruit's exterior sometimes features five distinct sides created by shallow ribs, and the stem-end is capped with a thin, dark brown, and brittle star-shaped calyx. The fruit’s skin is thin, being easily damaged, bruised, or punctured, and has a smooth, glossy, taut, and waxy feel. The skin ripens from dark green to shades of light green, yellow-green, ivory, to white when ripe. Underneath the surface, the flesh is crisp, firm, aqueous, and pale green when young, lightening in color, and becoming softer and more jelly-like as it ages. When sliced in half, the fruits reveal a five-pointed star in the center of the flesh and contain 6 to 7 tiny, light brown seeds. Bilimbi fruits release a refreshing aroma and are edible raw or cooked. When raw, the fruits taste sour, acidic, tart, and tangy.",
        "fact": "Bilimbi, botanically classified as Averrhoa bilimbi, is a tropical species belonging to the Oxalidaceae family. The small fruits develop on evergreen trees reaching 10 to 15 meters in height and grow in hanging clusters directly from the trunk or dangling stems. Bilimbi fruits typically mature 50 to 60 days after flowering, and each tree can produce 45 to 50 kilograms of fruit per year. The fruits are carefully picked by hand in clusters or individually from the tree, and some ripe versions are also collected from the ground. Bilimbi is the Hindi name for the species, and the fruits are prevalent in India as medicinal and culinary ingredients. The fruits are also known by several descriptors worldwide, including Tree Cucumbers, Tree Sorrel, and Pickle Tree in English-speaking regions, Billing-Billing, Belimbing Buloh, Belimbing Asam, and B’Ling in Malaysia, Blimbing, Blimbing Wuluh, Balimbing, Belimbing Besu in Indonesia, Taling Pling or Kaling Pring in Thailand, Pias, Camias, and Kamias in the Philippines, and Khe Tay in Vietnam.

The fruits are also extensively used in natural medicines throughout Southeast Asia as an anti-inflammatory.",

Some of the more commercially-important varieties include Washington navel, Valencia, Satsuma, and Seville. Despite the popular belief that they earned their name from the color of their skin, Oranges earned their name from the Sanskrit word naranga, meaning fragrant. This word was then known as narang in Arabic and was incorporated into the English language from the French word orenge.

As those individual berries develop from the plant’s flowers, they fuse together around the fruit stem in the center of the plant to form the pineapple, while the stem itself serves as the fruit’s core.
