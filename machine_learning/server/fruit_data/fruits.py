        "origin": "The Caribbean island of Aruba",
        "description": "Aloe leaves may vary in length, anywhere from 30 to 50 centimeters long, and are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The succulent leaves are firm and have a smooth, green skin with a fleshy texture. The skin is fibrous and bitter and is not typically consumed. The clear, inner flesh or “gel” of the Aloe plant has a texture like the flesh of a firm grape. Between the thick, protective skin and the translucent, jelly-like flesh is a bitter, viscous yellow-hued sap that needs to be rinsed off. Raw Aloe has a clean, refreshing taste and a slightly green flavor that is mildly bitter. The flesh will take on the flavors of any brine or liquid it is cooked in. Aloe can be used both raw and cooked. Slice off the spiny edges and remove the skin using a peeler or knife. The gelatinous Aloe can be cut into cubes or strips. Most recipes suggest rinsing or soaking the aloe prior to use so any bitterness from the skin and sap is removed. Raw Aloe can be blended with water to make Aloe juice, or into smoothies or other beverages. To flavor Aloe, add different spices, citrus juices, sugar, salt or other seasonings to the soaking or poaching water. Once soaked or cooked, cubes of Aloe can be eaten as is, chilled and added to acai bowls or parfaits, or used for hors d’oeuvres, sushi, curries or soups. If adding to soups, wait until the end of the cooking process before adding the rinsed and prepared Aloe. In India, Aloe is sweetened and added to yogurt for breakfast or added to other desserts. It is also an ingredient in sabzis, which are traditional vegetable dishes. Add slices or cubes of Aloe to summer salads with cherry tomatoes and fresh mint and chill. Cut pieces of Aloe can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week in an air-tight container.",
        "fact": 'Aloe is a succulent plant, botanically and commonly known as Aloe vera, with a scientific classification of Aloe barbadensis or Aloe barbadensis var. chinensis. Aloe has been consumed and applied topically for thousands of years and is well-known for its health benefits.

The tuber has an inedible shiny brown skin with rough patches and faint growth rings ascending down to the tip. The starchy flesh of the Tapioca root is a light white or cream color and has a grainy texture similar to potatoes with a mild, sweet flavor. Tapioca root contains cyanogenic glucosides called saponins, the amount of which varies depending on the variety (“bitter” or “sweet”). Sweet Tapioca contains lower levels of the compound and requires less preparation prior to eating, which is why it is the variety most commonly available as a vegetable.

        "description": "Bitter ginger plants are comprised of long, thin, and leafy, upright stalks that produce 10 to 12 oval to oblong leaves ranging from 15 to 20 centimeters in length. In the summer, the plants develop cone-like inflorescences that taper slightly at the top, covered in overlapping scales, also known as bracts, averaging 3 to 10 centimeters in length. The scaly, waxy, and smooth inflorescences are green when young, transitioning into a bright red hue over time. The inflorescences also produce a few small yellow-white flowers and a slimy, viscous, and slippery liquid when mature. This liquid has a pleasant and refreshing ginger-like smell. Underneath the leafy plant, Bitter ginger develops long and skinny rhizomes approximately 2 to 3 centimeters in diameter with a knobby, variable appearance. The rhizome’s skin is tan to brown, sometimes showcasing red undertones, depending on soil and growing conditions, and has a rough, textured, and firm feel. The golden yellow flesh is dense, fibrous, and moist, bearing a chewy, crisp consistency. Bitter ginger releases a faintly zesty and slightly medicinal aroma and has an earthy, peppery, and bitter taste.",
        "fact": "Bitter ginger, botanically classified as Zingiber zerumbet, is an Asian ginger variety belonging to the Zingiberaceae family. The rhizomes grow from perennial, leafy plants that reach up to 1.2 meters in height and are an ancient variety that has been used in natural medicines for thousands of years. Bitter ginger is valued in Southeast Asia for its underground rhizome. The rhizome’s juice, essential oils, and flesh are incorporated into a wide array of medicinal and culinary applications. The tropical plant has also been naturalized worldwide, foraged for its colorful inflorescences, rhizomes, and leaves. Bitter ginger is known by several names, including Lempoyang in Malaysia and Indonesia, Pinecone ginger, Shampoo ginger, Hong Qiu Jiang in China, Awapuhi in Hawaii, and Wild ginger. The rhizomes are not commercially cultivated and are gathered from wild plants or found in home gardens. The fast-growing plants are also established as an ornamental in garden landscapes. Bitter ginger plants flower in the summer, and the inflorescences are harvested for decorative floral arrangements, while the rhizomes are collected throughout the year.",

        "description": "Kale is a non-heading, leafy form of wild cabbage that comes in a range of shapes, sizes, and colors, such as blue-green, yellow-green, white, red, or purple. Different cultivars are classified by differences in their stem length and their leaf structure, as some are flat and others are frilly. The standard Kale we usually find in the grocery store is pale to deep green with large, ruffle-edged leaves and long stems. It is hardy and fibrous when fully mature, and tender enough to be used as a raw salad green when young. The pale green stems are tough and typically removed, while the tightly curled leaves are chewy yet succulent. Depending on the variety, Kale can sometimes be spicy, other times a bit sweet, and usually slightly bitter. In general, Kale offers an earthy flavor with a nutty sweetness that is accentuated when cooked.",
        "fact": "Kale is very easy to grow, and it can handle cold temperatures. In fact, a good fall frost or mild, cool winter can actually impart a high sugar content and fine flavor into the Kale plant. Kale is a member of the Mustard family, also called the Cabbage family. It’s a variety of Brassica oleracea known as acephala, meaning “without a head”, and is essentially a form of primitive cabbage. Over the last few thousand years, this one plant – wild cabbage, also called wild mustard plant – was selectively bred based on specific morphologic traits in order to create entirely different crops: Kale, head cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kohlrabi. Kale was produced from selections of wild cabbage plants with larger leaves, and today there are many unique Kale cultivars including Scottish curly Kale, the most commonly found variety, Black Kale, an Italian variety known for the dinosaur-like scales on its leaves, and Siberian Kale, known to be one of the most cold hardy. However, it is important to note that Siberian Kale is actually a different species than most other varieties that are derived from Brassica oleracea. Instead, Siberian Kale is classified as Brassica napus, which is still in the same family, although it is more closely related to rutabagas than other Kales.",
